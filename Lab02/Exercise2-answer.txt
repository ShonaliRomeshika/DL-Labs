1. When increase the number of hidden nodes in the above code, the neural network's capacity to learn complex patterns and features in the data increases. This can improve its ability to fit the training data more closely and potentially lead to higher training accuracy. 

2. Increasing the number of hidden nodes initially boosts the network's capacity to learn, leading to improved training accuracy. However, as the number of hidden nodes continues to increase, the network becomes more prone to overfitting, causing a drop in accuracy on new data.
